Programming Concepts in Python

PyCharm
	- jet brains pycharm community edition


repl.it

using python 3

Python 3
	- unicode support
	- libraries changed
	- no semicolons needed

Libraries
	- import math
	- math.pi

Where is python on windows?
	- Often c:\pythonXX

# Monday afternoon, June 20th1. Sharing: Program designa. When to teach program flow logicb. How to teach program design: algorithm,flow-charts,etc? 

What techniques are you using to teach algorithms? Flow charts, UDL’s, etc.? (shin likes dancing instructions)

2. .pyCodestructure–left-edge justification

if a == 1:
	print(‘a is one’)
	print(‘blahblahblah’)

You must follow the indenting - no semicolons or curly braces

There is no container for main

# comments begin this way
3. Variables: naming (C convention) and declaring (not!)

Integers and Floating Point numbers

x = 0.0
x += .1
x += .1
x += .1
x += .1
x += .1
x += .1
x += .1
x += .1
x += .1
x += .1

if x == 1.0:
    print ('x is one')
else:
    print ('x is not one')

print ('x is', x)

a = ‘hello’
b = ‘world’
c = a+b
print (c)

# immutable string

we don’t have to declare variable types but they will change!!!
4. Literals: decimals and quotes and apostrophes

- whether it has a decimal point or not
5. Hands-on:“MakingChange,3.4”and“MyDays,3.5”
